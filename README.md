## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Homelun CMS is a powerful real state CMS , offering a robust role-based system that includes three types of users: super admin, admin, and agent. Each role has its specific responsibilities and capabilities, ensuring smooth and efficient management of the platform.

The super admin has full control over the platform and can create new users with admin or agent roles. Admins have the ability to manage and approve properties added by agents, while agents can add property listings and handle property tour requests, among other tasks. This hierarchical structure allows for clear delegation of tasks and efficient management of property listings, making Homelun an ideal choice for real estate professionals looking for a comprehensive solution to manage their websites.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started with Homelun CMS, you'll need to set up the server and client environments. First, navigate to the server folder in your project directory and create an .env file. Use the provided env.example file as a reference to fill in the required information. Once your .env file is set up, you can install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```
npm install
or
yarn install
```

After setting up the server, move on to the client folder and repeat the process. Create an .env file using the env.example as a guide, and then install the required dependencies like previous way.

then run both separately with

```
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```



```
